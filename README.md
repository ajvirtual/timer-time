# timertime
  timertime is an application for training Rubik's cube, This is a rubik's cube timer, there is some special feature that actually no timer out there have. training feature is very nice it contain blind folded trainning, several subset algorithm training ( i'll try to put all of them over time), 
  You can record your time and just see full time list all over the time you've record it
  You can also record a video with the aid of your webcam, the video will contains you solving and your time in real-time just splites side by sides, afterward you can see it in your local download directory.
have fun ;)
